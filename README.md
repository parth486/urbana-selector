### Build Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

### State Management

Each app uses Zustand for state management:

- **Stepper**: `useStepperStore` - Manages form progress and selections
- **Data Builder**: `useDataBuilderStore` - Manages product data CRUD
- **Admin Orders**: `useAdminOrdersStore` - Manages submissions and filters

### API Endpoints

The plugin creates the following REST API endpoints:

- `POST /wp-json/urbana/v1/submit-form` - Submit stepper form
- `GET /wp-json/urbana/v1/submissions` - Get customer submissions (admin)
- `PATCH /wp-json/urbana/v1/submissions/{id}` - Update submission (admin)
- `DELETE /wp-json/urbana/v1/submissions/{id}` - Delete submission (admin)
- `GET /wp-json/urbana/v1/product-data` - Get product configuration (admin)
- `POST /wp-json/urbana/v1/product-data` - Update product configuration (admin)

### Database Tables

- `wp_urbana_submissions` - Customer form submissions
- `wp_urbana_product_data` - Product configuration data

## Customization

### Theming

The plugin uses HeroUI's theming system. You can customize colors and appearance by modifying the Tailwind configuration or by adding custom CSS.

### Product Data Structure

Product data follows this structure:
```javascript
{
  stepperForm: {
    steps: [
      {
        step: 1,
        title: "Select Product Group",
        categories: ["Shelter", "Toilet", "Bridge", ...]
      },
      // ... more steps
    ]
  }
}
```

### Adding Custom Steps

1. Update the product data structure
2. Create new step components in `src/stepper-app/components/steps/`
3. Register the step in the `ProductStepper` component
4. Update the store logic for validation

## Performance Considerations

- Built assets are optimized and chunked for efficient loading
- Database queries use proper indexing
- Frontend state is persisted to prevent data loss
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimized bundle sizes with tree shaking

## Security

- Nonce verification for all AJAX requests
- Capability checks for admin functions
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- XSS protection with proper escaping

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES2020 support
- Mobile responsive design
- Progressive enhancement approach
